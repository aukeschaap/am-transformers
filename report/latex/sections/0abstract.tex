    Due to the wide adoption of solar panels, electic vehicles, and other technologies, the energy supply and consumption in Netherlands has changed drastically. This has led to a change in the load profile of the distribution transformers, which are used to step down the voltage from the medium voltage grid to the low voltage grid. 
    Currently, models do not accurately reflect the behaviour of the transformers under these new conditions. 
    This paper presents a model that can accurately model the magnetic field without assuming a sinusoidal source current. The model can be used to model any frequency, as well as multiple frequencies. The model also correctly captures the behaviour of the core at loads close to the saturation point, by including the non-linear permeability of the core material.
    These are both improvements over the current linear models, which are not able to capture these behaviours.
