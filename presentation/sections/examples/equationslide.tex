\begin{frame}{Mass--energy equivalence}
	They say every formula you add to a presentation, will reduce your audience by \SI{50}{\percent}. A simple yet effective way to mitigate this effect, is adding a compact nomenclature to the slides containing formulae.
	
	\[E=mc^2\]
	
	If you find this is taking up too much of your precious space, than you are doing something wrong, and it is not adding this little nomenclature.
	
	The optional argument specifies the number of column pairs.
	
\mininomen[2]{% number of columns
  $E$ & Energy (\unit{J})                     & $m$ & Mass (\unit{kg}) \\
  $c$ & Speed of light in vacuum (\unit{m/s}) \\[2ex] % may need some tweaking
